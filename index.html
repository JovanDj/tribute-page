			<h2>Bio</h2>

			<p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics
				in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
				Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would
				become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York
				City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas,
				Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical
				devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed
				by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone
				of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.</p>

			<p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments
				with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also
				built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an
				inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and
				was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.</p>

			<p>Throughout the 1890s, Tesla would pursue his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric
				power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado
				Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.
				Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an
				intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could
				complete it.</p>
